## Description 
We brainstormed and brainstormed and dreamed.   Our almost novel idea was born, with the concept of adding to a users travel packing list, by being able to find a book that is set in the city or region that you are travelling to.   Sometimes it gets you excited about your destination.   For example, a user might be travelling to New Orleans and wants to read a book set in the Crescent City that is mystery.     When the user inputs their destination city and selects "Mystery" as their desired genre the API will make a call to Open Library to obtain a list of books set in New Orleans with a "Mystery" Genre.  Then a 2nd call is made to Google Books, where we filter out the results to present the top 10 books based on the number of reviews. The user is then presented with their top 10 books in that destination city.   Don't worry if you are not actually travelling anywhere, you can still select your list of books to escape with.
